Near the corners of the maze are four larger, flashing dots known as Power Pellets that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the ghosts, reversing the usual pattern. When all pac-dots are eaten, the player advances to the next level.

Near the corners of the maze are four larger, flashing dots known as Power Pellets that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the ghosts, reversing the usual pattern. When all pac-dots are eaten, the player advances to the next level.
