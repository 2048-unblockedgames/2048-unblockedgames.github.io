Near the corners of the maze are four larger, flashing dots known as Power Pellets that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the ghosts, reversing the usual pattern. When all pac-dots are eaten, the player advances to the next level.

The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king, whereby the king is under immediate attack (in 'check') and there is no way for it to escape. Chess requires deep strategic thinking, foresight, and the ability to anticipate your opponent's moves. With origins dating back to the 6th century in India, chess has evolved into one of the world's most popular games, played by millions and recognized as both a sport and an art form.","url":"https://www.chess.com/play/computer","thumbnail":"/placeholder.svg?height=150&width=250","category":"Strategy","tags":["board game","thinking","multiplayer","classic"],"difficulty":"Hard","popularity":87,"releaseYear":600,"controls":"Mouse drag and drop","metaKeywords":"chess game, strategy game, board game, thinking game, free online games, unblocked games"},{"id":"crossy-road","title":"Crossy Road Adventure","shortTitle":"Crossy Road","description":"Guide animals across busy roads, train tracks, and hazardous rivers in this modern take on the classic arcade game.

The game uses a standard 52-card deck and challenges players to sort all cards into four foundation piles by suit in ascending order (from Ace to King). To achieve this, players must strategically move cards around the tableau, building descending sequences alternating between red and black cards. Solitaire combines elements of luck and strategy, making each game unique. It's known for being both relaxing and mentally stimulating, offering a perfect balance of challenge and accessibility.","url":"https://www.solitr.com/","thumbnail":"/placeholder.svg?height=150&width=250","category":"Card","tags":["cards","patience","classic","single-player"],"difficulty":"Easy","popularity":89,"releaseYear":1700,"controls":"Mouse drag and drop","metaKeywords":"solitaire game, card game, klondike, patience game, free online games, unblocked games"}],"categories":[{"name":"Puzzle","description":"Challenge your brain with logic puzzles, pattern recognition, and problem-solving games.
