Near the corners of the maze are four larger, flashing dots known as Power Pellets that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the ghosts, reversing the usual pattern.

Players control a character (typically a chicken or other animal) and must navigate across busy roads, train tracks, and rivers while avoiding obstacles like cars, trains, and water. The goal is to travel as far as possible without dying, with each successful crossing adding to your score. The game features a distinctive voxel-based visual style and a wide variety of unlockable characters, each with unique visual themes. Developed by Hipster Whale and released in 2014, Crossy Road quickly became a mobile gaming phenomenon for its simple yet addictive gameplay.","url":"https://poki.com/en/g/crossy-road","thumbnail":"/placeholder.svg?height=150&width=250","category":"Arcade","tags":["crossing","endless runner","animals","obstacles"],"difficulty":"Medium","popularity":86,"releaseYear":2014,"controls":"Arrow keys, WASD, or tap (mobile)","metaKeywords":"crossy road game, endless runner, arcade game, animal game, free online games, unblocked games"},{"id":"solitaire","title":"Solitaire Card Classic","shortTitle":"Solitaire","description":"The classic single-player card game.

To achieve this, players must strategically move cards around the tableau, building descending sequences alternating between red and black cards. Solitaire combines elements of luck and strategy, making each game unique.
