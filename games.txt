The game uses a standard 52-card deck and challenges players to sort all cards into four foundation piles by suit in ascending order (from Ace to King). To achieve this, players must strategically move cards around the tableau, building descending sequences alternating between red and black cards. Solitaire combines elements of luck and strategy, making each game unique. It's known for being both relaxing and mentally stimulating, offering a perfect balance of challenge and accessibility.","url":"https://unblockedgamesfree.github.io/solitaire/","thumbnail":"/img/solitaire.png?height=150&width=250","category":"Card","tags":["cards","patience","classic","single-player"],"difficulty":"Easy","popularity":89,"releaseYear":1700,"releaseMonth":1,"controls":"Mouse drag and drop","metaKeywords":"solitaire game, card game, klondike, patience game, free online games, unblocked games","rating":4.7,"playCount":17000000,"features":["Multiple solitaire variants","Auto-complete option","Undo/redo moves","Score tracking","Statistics system"],"howToPlay":["Build foundation piles by suit","Create descending sequences","Alternate red and black cards","Move cards between columns","Reveal hidden cards"],"tips":["Empty columns are valuable","Expose hidden cards quickly","Plan moves in sequence","Keep color balance in mind"],"achievements":[{"name":"Quick Win","description":"Win under 5 minutes","reward":"Bronze Card"},{"name":"Perfect Game","description":"Win with maximum score","reward":"Gold Card"}],"statistics":{"averagePlayTime":"15 minutes","gamesWon":17000000,"winRate":"35%","averageMoves":65,"perfectGames":1000},"educationalBenefits":["Improves concentration","Develops planning skills","Enhances pattern recognition","Trains short-term memory","Reduces stress"],"updates":[{"version":"2.2.0","date":"2024-02-08","changes":["Added new game variants","Improved card animations","Enhanced statistics tracking","New themes added"]}],"reviews":[{"rating":5,"comment":"The perfect way to relax and exercise your mind!","author":"CardSharp","date":"2024-02-17"}]}],"categories":[{"name":"Puzzle","description":"Challenge your brain with logic puzzles, pattern recognition, and problem-solving games.
